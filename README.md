# CoStrx-s-CPS-Website

<<UPDATE:>> Photo loading fix coming soon.

This is a site I made for Computer Studies. It's comprised of HTML, JS, and CSS.

I built this using Svelte and TypeScript after the initial HTML didn't look so great. From there, I went on to effectively learn TypeScript and Svelte, and how to use the pnpm utility.
Then I shifted it back to HTML for the required output.

Things I would do better next time include having an actual navbar, potentially videos of these cars, or maybe a better UI/UX.

Thanks for taking a look.

Please note: if the page doesn't display on GitHub, let me know and I can run a remote devserver for you to see it.
Thanks.
